# CAFE-SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS-USING-EXCEL
This project is all about cleaning and analyzing sales data from a cafe to uncover useful insights and highlight important business metrics. The original dataset had missing values, wrong totals, and inconsistent categories, so I carefully cleaned and fixed these issues to make the data reliable for analysis.
